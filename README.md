This repository hosts the code essential for my PhD project focused on analyzing intonation patterns within tone languages.

The documentation includes two Jupyter notebooks that detail the data processing workflow, providing step-by-step instructions and scripts necessary for the procedure.

- Workbook_01P2FAalignment.ipynb
- Workbook_02processing.ipynb

These workbooks contain cells that may execute bash, Praat, and Python scripts, such as extract_acoustics.py and those within the script_praat directory. While these scripts can operate independently, the workbook is designed to centralize their execution within a single environment, minimizing the need to switch between different computing environments.

## Explore the demonstration website

Visit this [website](https://kc-li.github.io/InTone_Visualisation_Site/index.html) for an interactive demonstration of audios and data visualisations. This is associated with the Prosody Visualisation Challenge (PVC) at ICPhS 2023. For further details, consult the [proceeding paper](https://guarant.cz/icphs2023/1119.pdf).

The accompanying audio files for the PVC challenge are available for download in the Audiofiles folder, designed with a specific naming convention:

Changsha [Language] - T1 [Tonal condition on the target syllable] - Subj [Focus on subject (or on object)]
