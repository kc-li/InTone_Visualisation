```

## check for two things: missing f0, or jump f0

1. We first want to give a report about the f0 errors by file, combinig the missing and the jumping
2. For each file, we save the visualisation of these files.
3. Then in python, we run a script to extract these files into a seperate folder. We also have a query system, to show the visualisation figure of a file
4. Use praat to open thse files and modifiy the boundary. It is likely that we will need to generate 

```{r}

```
